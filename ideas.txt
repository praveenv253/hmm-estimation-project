- Fit spike trains of different frequencies.
  + Parameters are amplitude, frequency, phase
- Choose some frequencies for these spike trains and remove that component

- Condense to 0/1 and try to pull out spike trains

- Model with spikes that follow a poisson point process, and each spike sets off a burst (which is characterized somehow)
  => Estimate spike rate (this is the exponential fit)
  => Estimate parameters of the burst

- Main problem is that it is very hard to do cross-validation for these kinds of models, because of insufficient data

----

What kinds of questions can you ask out of this dataset?

=> Heavy usage periods 

=> Burst properties (this is the exponential fit)
